# Art-Museum-Database

## Project Description
This is a copy of the repository used in creating the group final project for the class "ENSF 300 Software Engineering Practices for Data Management". The terminal-based application is created using python and interfaces with a database created with SQL. The application allows for different user role selections. Based on user's role, users can data enter, retrieve and manipulate data. 

Included in this repository is the SQL script used in the initialization of the database, the Python file for the art museum application and a pdf containing task distribution and the data models used in planning this project.

1. Initialize the database by running "ARTSMUSUEM.sql" in MySQL workbench or another SQL application.
